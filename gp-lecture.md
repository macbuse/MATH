# Background

The [text](https://www.math.brown.edu/~res/Papers/surfacebook.pdf) is english so it might be useful to read some background material in english before the class.


Follow the blue arrows -> for a reference.


### Geometry and groups


Most of this is covered in the algebra classes and should be well known.
You should look at this before the first class. 

If you want to look at something a bit more challenging then look [here](https://if-summer2018.sciencesconf.org/data/pages/origamis_Grenoble_matheus_3.pdf).

- finite subgroups of $SO(3)$ [->1]
- regular polyhedra [->4]
- discrete subgroups of $\text{isom}^+(\mathbb{R}^2)$ 
- classification of isometries of $\mathbb{R}^2$ [->2]
- geodesics in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{S}^2$
- automorphisms of $\mathbb{Z}^2$
- classification of  elements of $\text{SL}(2, \mathbb{R})$ [->3]
- Stereographic Projection [->5]
