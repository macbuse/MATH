# Background

The [text](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~v1ranick/papers/conwaysens.pdf) 
is english so it might be useful to read some background material in english before the class.

There is a more recent [text](https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/TN/TNpage.html)
which has a lot of overlap with Conway's book
and we will be comparing the two versions when appropriate.

The theme of both books is the interplay between geometry 
and number theory.

Follow the blue arrows -> for a reference.
