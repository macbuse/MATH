# Stage M2R

Greg McShane 2017-18


## Context

Apollonian circle packings are one of the most beautiful circle packings whose construction can be described
in a very simple manner based on an old theorem of Apollonius (262- 190 BC).
It says that given three mutually tangent circles in the plane,
there are exactly two circles which are tangent to all the three circles.
See [Pollicott](https://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/~masdbl/apollo-29Dec2014.pdf)
for an account of the history.

In fact, these are examples of the limit sets of cocompact [Kleinian groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleinian_group).
The problem of counting the number of circles with diameter larger than T
has deep connections with the ergodic theory of hyperbolic 3 manifolds.
Over the last 10 years many significant advances have been made
in particular by :

- Bourgain and his collaborators
- Hee Oh and Kontorovich

based on fundamental work of Dani, Margulis, and Roblin.


## Details of the stage

We will read throught the papers of Kontorovich and Hee Oh
listed in the references and study the different counting
problems -- in particular the proof of an asymptotic
formula for the number of circles with diameter larger than T
in the apollonian packing.

If time permits we will discuss
- possible generalizations to discrete subgroups of Lie group other than PSL(2,C).
- thin groups
