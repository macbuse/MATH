#Algebraic flows

The course covers the properties of
the geodesic and unipotent/horocyclic
flows for homogeneous spaces:

- ergodicity
- mixing
- invariant subsets and orbit closures
- applications to study of quadratic forms


The main examples will come from flows  on hyperbolic surfaces and hyperbolic 3 manifolds but if time permits we will also give examples that come from compact quotients of the  Heisenberg group.

##Requirements

- basic measure theory
- some elementary functional analysis
- decompositions of Lie groups (Bruhat Iwasa, Cartan, polar decompositions)
